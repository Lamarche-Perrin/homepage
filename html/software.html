		<li><b><a href="https://github.com/Lamarche-Perrin/data.cube" target="_blank">data.cube</a>:  An R package for the easy processing of multidimensional data  (2017 – in development)</b><br>
		  This R package aims at the exploration of multidimensional datasets and at the detection of statistical outliers within. It is mainly a tool for data exploration, allowing to have a first glance at it and to formulate research hypotheses to be later tested.<br>

		<li><b><a href="https://github.com/Lamarche-Perrin/triversity" target="_blank">triversity</a>: Diversity Measures on Tripartite Graphs (2017 – in development)</b><br>
		  This R package aims at computing diversity measures on tripartite graphs. It first implements a parametrized family of such diversity measures which apply on probability distributions. Sometimes called "True Diversity", this family contains famous measures such as the richness, the Shannon entropy, the Herfindahl-Hirschman index, and the Berger-Parker index. Second, the package allows to apply these measures on probability distributions resulting from random walks between the levels of tripartite graphs. By defining an initial distribution at a given level of the graph and a path to follow between the three levels, the probability of the walker's position within the final level is then computed, thus providing a particular instance of diversity to measure.
		  The package is available on <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=triversity" target="_blank">CRAN</a>.<br>

		  This program is a toolbox to solve special versions of the Set Partitioning Problem, that is the combinatorial optimisation of a decomposable objective over a set of feasible partitions (defined according to specific algebraic structures: e.g., hierachies, sets of intervals, graphs). The objectives are mainly based on information theory, in the perspective of multilevel analysis of large-scale datasets, and the algorithms are based on dynamic programming. <span id="nopdf">For details regarding the formal grounds of this work, please refer to <a href="http://www.mis.mpg.de/publications/preprints/2014/prepr2014-105.html" target="_blank">this paper</a>.</span></br>

		  Ocelotl is an innovative visualization tool, which provides overviews for execution trace analysis by using a data aggregation technique. This technique enables to find anomalies in huge traces containing up to several billions of events, while keeping a fast computation time and providing a simple representation that does not overload the user. It uses a C++ implementation of my aggregation algorithms within the <a href="https://github.com/dosimont/lpaggreg" target="_blanck">lpaggreg</a> library. <span id="nopdf">For details regarding the formal grounds of this work, please refer to <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CLUSTER.2014.6968741" target="_blank">this paper</a>.</span><br>

		<li><b><a href="https://github.com/schnorr/viva" target="_blank">Viva</a>: Alternative visualization techniques for trace analysis (2012 – 2015)</b><br>
		  Viva is an open-source tool used to analyze traces (in the Paje File Format) registered during the execution of parallel or distributed applications. The tool also serves as a sandbox to the development of new visualization techniques. Current features include:
		  temporal integration using dynamic time-intervals,
		  spatial aggregation through hierarchical traces,
		  interactive graph visualization with a force-directed algorithm, with viva,
		  and squarified Treemap to compare processes behavior on scale, with vv_treemap.<br>
